# AAB-003 Rescue Module (AAB003X1)

This folder contains the full Moleculogic and SEI-driven rescue package for AAB-003 (Crenezumab analog), a failed anti-amyloid-beta IgG4 monoclonal antibody originally developed by Roche and AC Immune for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.

## Rescue Summary

- **Drug Name:** AAB-003
- **Rescue ID:** AAB003X1
- **Blueprint ID:** MDC-CRNZ-Ï‡1
- **Disease Area:** Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
- **Original Problem:** Phase 3 trial failure due to poor cognitive outcomes and ineffective synaptic protection.
- **Rescue Strategy:** Logic-based redesign into a non-antibody metal-drug complex targeting AÎ²-tau synergy, oxidative stress, and blood-brain permeability.

## Internal Notes

- SEI validation was completed on 2025-06-05.
- Rescue scored high on confidence and low on entropy variance.
- Recommended next action: Send outreach to Roche (email drafted).
- Tier 3 promotion pending on validation of predicted synergy inhibition in simulation mode.
